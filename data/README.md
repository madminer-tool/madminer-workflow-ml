# Initial data


### About
This folder contains a sample H5 dataset (`dummy_data.h5`) which serves as initial data file
to run the workflow locally using Yadage.

```shell script
make yadage-run
```


### Generation
The sample dataset has been generated running the [Physics workflow][madminer-workflow-ph] locally,
as the project was defined on a specific point in time.
